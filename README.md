# Tensor Network Kalman Filter for Large-Scale Least Squares Support Vector Machines 

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Tensor Network Kalman Filtering for Large-Scale LSSVMs".
(pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13501v1)

There are five TNKF implementations on different datasets. 

Note: The datasets are not all my own work, please credit/cite the respective people and institutions for these!
